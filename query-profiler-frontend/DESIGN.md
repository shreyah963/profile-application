# Query Profiler Dashboard â€“ Design Document

---

## Overview

The Query Profiler Dashboard is a React-based application for visualizing and comparing Opensearch query profile outputs. It provides two main interfaces:
- **MainDashboard:** For uploading, exploring, and analyzing a single profile.
- **ComparisonDashboard:** For comparing two profiles side by side.

---

## MainDashboard (Central interface for visualizing profile outputs)

**Purpose:**  
To allow users to upload a query profile, visualize shard and query performance, and drill down into detailed metrics for each query or aggregation.

**Visual Layout:**

**Block/Class Mapping:**

| UI Block                        | Component            | Purpose/Functionality                                      |
|----------------------------------|-----------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| Query Profiler Dashboard         | ProfilerDashboard           | Main container, header, and state management               |
| Profile Actions [Upload][Compare]| ProfilerDashboard            | Upload profile, compare mode, file validation              |
| Shard Visualization              | ShardVisualization,  | Visualizes shard performance and selection      |
| Left Panel (Query Hierarchy)     | ProfilerQueries, | Tree view of queries/aggregations             |
| Right Panel (Query Detail)       | QueryDetail | Operation breakdown, timing, structure, metrics   |

**Key Features:**
- Upload and validate profile files (JSON)
- Visualize shard performance
- Explore query/aggregation hierarchy
- View detailed metrics for selected queries

## ComparisonDashboard (Central interface for comparing profile outputs)

**Purpose:**  
To allow users to upload or paste two profiles and view a side-by-side comparison of their structure and performance.

**Visual Layout:**

**Block/Class Mapping:**

| UI Block                | Component                | Purpose/Functionality                                 |
|-------------------------|--------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| Profile Comparison Mode | ComparisonDashboard            | Main container, header, and state management          |
| Profile 1 Input         | ProfilerCompare | Upload/paste first profile                            |
| Profile 2 Input         | ProfilerCompare | Upload/paste second profile                           |
| Comparison Results      | ProfilerComparisonResults | Show differences, structure, and metrics |

**Key Features:**
- Upload or paste two profiles for comparison
- Validate both profiles
- View differences in query structure and output differences

---

## Component/Class Responsibilities

- **ProfilerDashboard:** Orchestrates the main dashboard, manages state, and renders all subcomponents.
- **ShardVisualization:** Renders shard performance and allows selection.
- **ProfilerQueries:** Displays the query/aggregation hierarchy as a tree.
- **QueryDetail:** Shows detailed metrics for the selected query/aggregation.
- **ProfilerCompare:** Handles input and validation for two profiles in comparison mode.
- **ProfilerComparisonResults:** Renders the results of the profile comparison.

---

## User Flow

1. **MainDashboard:**
   - User uploads a profile output.
   - Shard visualization and query hierarchy are populated.
   - User selects a query/aggregation to view details.

2. **ComparisonDashboard:**
   - User uploads or pastes two profiles.
   - User clicks "Compare".
   - Side-by-side comparison results are displayed.

---

## Visual/Interaction Notes

- Each block is styled with a dedicated CSS class for clarity and maintainability.
- The layout is responsive and adapts to different screen sizes.
- Color coding and clear separation of blocks help users quickly understand the dashboard structure.

---

## Accessibility & Best Practices

- All interactive elements are keyboard accessible.
- Sufficient color contrast is maintained.
- Error handling and validation are provided for all user inputs.
